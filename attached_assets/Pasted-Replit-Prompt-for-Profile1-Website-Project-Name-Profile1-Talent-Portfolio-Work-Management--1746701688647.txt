Website Purpose

Create a personal portfolio site that showcases the work and profiles of freelancers (designers, editors, animators, etc.) under my network. I use this site to:

Show off other people’s talent to clients

Match the right freelancer to client needs

Track work progress and task assignments

Add and manage portfolios and profiles

Design Inspiration

Take style and layout ideas from:

LinkedIn (for profile structure and details)

Instagram (for showcasing media/reels)

The Souled Store (for product-style layout and visual appeal)


Use a clean, modern, responsive design with clear visuals and rounded cards. Use soft shadows, filter/sort options, and hover effects.

Additional Suggestions to Improve Website

1. Tag System – Allow tags like "Logo", "3D", "Poster" to help users filter easily.


2. Categories – Define categories for each type of service (animation, design, video, etc.)


3. Color Mode Switch – Light/Dark toggle for a more professional look.


4. Hover Preview – Let users preview videos/images on hover.


5. Auto Save / Drafts – For work or profiles being uploaded in parts.


6. Backend Suggestions:

Firebase: for login, file upload, database (easy and free tier available)

Supabase: alternative with a SQL-style DB, good for structured data



7. Page Transitions using Framer Motion for a modern feel.


8. Export/Download – Option to export work list or profiles in CSV for record keeping.


9. Admin-only Edit Rights – Allow only you to add/edit/delete.
